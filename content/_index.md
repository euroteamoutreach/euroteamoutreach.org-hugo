# Page copy, rendered section by section by layouts/index.html. Source draft:
# planning/copy/home.md; tweaks happen in situ (#56). UGO strings go through
# layouts/partials/ugo-copy.html, so {trip_dates}, {trip_year} and
# {box_price} work here too. Published-copy conventions apply: russia/russian
# lowercase, Lviv without an apostrophe, KJV for Scripture.

# The legacy home's cover photo, kept for continuity with the site long-time
# supporters know. Shot on a CMO project; the team-around-a-map scene is as
# true of the work today. The blue wash is CSS (layouts/index.html), not baked
# into the file.

    Euro Team Outreach is a Christian missions organization that has served in Ukraine since 2004 — a small, family-rooted team of American missionaries, working hand in hand with Ukrainian believers and local churches. For over two decades, we've had a singular focus, in changing forms: making Jesus Christ known — preaching the Gospel, teaching the Bible through our *Bible First* course, and discipling the next generation of laborers in the field.

    From our base in Lviv, that calling reaches across the country — city squares and mountain villages, and now the de-occupied towns near the front, where families are holding on under hard conditions. We come to introduce people to Jesus through the pages of Scripture, and to meet real needs as we go. The war has changed our methods, not our message.

# Every ministry is first-class here: a first-time visitor should see that
# ETO is more than UGO. UGO leads because it is the work in the field now.

We go village by village with the Gospel and a box of food, hand-delivered to families who are still holding on. And in {trip_year}, we're going back."

  # Pre-UGO track (#21): none of these has an on-site page yet, so every

  # says the project is retired, so the card does. All three move to on-site
  # pages in Phase 2.
