// confirmation, which the form marks with x-ref="success". Netlify accepts an AJAX
// submission at "/" and routes it by the form-name field. HTML5 validation
// still runs first: @submit.prevent only fires once the browser's required and
// type="email" checks pass.

// very bottom the last section wins, even if it is too short to reach the line.
